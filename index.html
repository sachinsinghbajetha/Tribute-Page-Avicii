        <p id="tribute-info">Tim Bergling, known by his stage name Avicii was a Swedish DJ, remixer, record producer,
            musician, and songwriter. At the age of 16, Bergling began posting his remixes on electronic music forums,
            which led to his first record deal. He rose to prominence in 2011 with his single "Levels". His debut studio
            album, True (2013), blended electronic music with elements of multiple genres and received generally
            positive reviews. It peaked in the top ten in more than fifteen countries and topped international charts
            the lead single, "Wake Me Up", topped most music markets in Europe and reached number four in the United
            States. In 2015, Bergling released his second studio album, Stories, and in 2017 he released an EP, Avīci.
            His catalog also included the singles "I Could Be the One" with Nicky Romero, "You Make Me", "X You", "Hey
            Brother", "Addicted to You", "The Days", "The Nights", "Waiting for Love", "Without You" and "Lonely
            Together". Bergling was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work on "Sunshine" with David Guetta in 2012
            and "Levels" in 2013. Several music publications credit Bergling as among the DJs who ushered electronic
            music into Top 40 radio in the early 2010s. Bergling retired from touring in 2016 due to health problems,
            having suffered from stress and poor mental health for several years. On 20 April 2018, he committed suicide
            in Muscat, Oman. His third album, Tim, was released posthumously in 2019.
